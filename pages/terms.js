        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mb-6 text-base space-y-2">
          <li>Tren Coins (TC) are digital tokens earned through skill-based play or referral promotions.</li>
          <li>
            TC may be withdrawn to an external crypto wallet at the user's request, but cannot be redeemed for cash, cryptocurrency, or any real-world value directly on TrenPlay.
          </li>
          <li>
            TrenPlay does not offer, support, or guarantee any exchange or sale of TC for real-world value. Any such activity occurs entirely outside of TrenPlay and at the userâ€™s own risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            TC may have no real-world value. The existence or availability of any secondary market is outside TrenPlay's control.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may lose TC through match play, failed matches, or platform rule violations. TrenPlay is not liable for any lost, forfeited, or spent TC due to gameplay, technical issues, or rule violations.
          </li>
        </ul>
